# Barre-Three
by Alena Golovina, 08.26.2017


## Description
This is a website that manages the roster of the Barre3 team.
Barre3 mixes athleticism, grace, and the latest innovations designed to balance the body.
Whether you have ten minutes or an hour, each full-body workout optimizes every moment with moves that adapt to your body for maximum results.

## User Stories:

* As a user, I'd like to visit a page to see a list of all team or club members.
* As a user, I'd like to click a team or club member's entry in the list to visit their profile page, which should include more details about them.
* As a user, I'd like the option to visit an "About" page that explains what the club is, and what they do.
* As a user, I'd like all data persisted in a database, so it's always there when I need it.
* As an administrator, I want to add new users to the club. (User authentication is not required).
* As an administrator, I want to edit user profiles, in case I make a mistake, or need to update their details.
* As an administrator, need the option to delete a user, in case they leave the club or team.

## Further Exploration/Additional Features

* Add functionality to keep track of stats, if relevant. Is your roster for a sports club? Keep track of the individual players' scoring percentage. An extracurricular course or seminar? Keep track of attendance or grades. A hiking group? Keep track of the number of miles each person has hiked with the club, etc.
* Add a message board area, where club members may chat with each other.
* Include an area called "announcements", "events", "games", etc. where users can post what events, matches, or meetings the club has planned.
* Deploy your application. Include a link to the live site in your project's README.
* Consider implementing AngularFire/Firebase user authentication (Note that this goes beyond the scope of our curriculum, and will require you to complete outside research. Begin with the AngularFire documentation on User Authentication.)
* Anything else that would be relevant to the group your application manages!
* As a user, I'd like to filter the list of users by their particular role in the group, or some other information/category. (For instance, a club may have a treasurer, president, and/or secretary. A sports team may have a goalie, forward, or striker, a book club may have founders and attendees. You're also welcome to filter by something other than role, if it's more relevant to your project.)

## Development server

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
